# 🚗 Tesla Stock Price Prediction using RNN 📉

This project uses a **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** to predict the stock price of **Tesla, Inc.** based on historical stock market data. The model is built using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**, employing a simple RNN architecture to predict future stock prices based on past performance. 📊

## 🚀 Features:
- **Data Processing**: Preprocessing using **Scikit-learn's `MinMaxScaler`** to scale the data for training.
- **Model**: A 3-layer **RNN** model built with **TensorFlow/Keras**, with **Dropout** layers to prevent overfitting.
- **Metrics**: Evaluates the model performance using **MAE**, **MSE**, and **R²** score.
- **TensorBoard**: Visualizes training progress with TensorBoard for better insights. 📈

## 📦 Requirements:
- Python 3.x 🐍
- **TensorFlow** 🧠
- **Keras** 🤖
- **Scikit-learn** 📊
- **Pandas** 📑
- **Matplotlib** 🎨
